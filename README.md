Visit

or clone this repo and serve index.html via LiveServer in Visual Studio Code. A page will load that asks you to choose a test subject by ID number from a drop-down menu. When you do so, only results matching that test subject will be returned. This creates a Plotly bar graph and <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/bubble-charts/" target="_blank">Plotly bubble chart</a> of the top ten bacteria found in that test subject's belly button by count, as well as a display of the test subject's demographic information, based on data from the <a href="http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity">Public Science Lab of North Carolina State University</a>.

If I did more wih this dataset, it could be interesting to tally total bacterial load per test subject and investigate whether there is a correlation between that and either number of times per week washed or having an innie versus an outie. I would also read more as a layperson about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_taxonomic_unit" target="_blank">Operational Taxonomic Units</a>.

This is homework 15 based on material covered April 7, 10, 12, 2021 in Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp at the University of Minnesota.
