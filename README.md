or clone this repo and serve index.html via LiveServer in Visual Studio Code. A page will load that asks you to choose a test subject by ID number from a drop-down menu. When you do so, only results matching that test subject will be returned. This creates a Plotly bar graph and Plotly bubble chart of the top ten bacteria found in that test subject's belly button by count, as well as a display of the test subject's demographic information.

This is homework 15 based on material covered April 7, 10, 12, 2021 in Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp at the University of Minnesota.
